Android Mobile App - Bankroll Breakdown Continued (Poker Journal)

This project is my personal work on an application that compliments a hobby dear to my heart.
Poker has been a hobby of mine since middle school, so developing an application I can engage to help monitor my game-play performance is immensely gratifying.

Bankroll Breakdown is a mobile application that lets users keep track of various qualities pertaining to their poker endeavors.

Below is a list of those qualities:
- Bankroll Balance (Money set aside specifically for poker)
- Bankroll Transactions (List of deposits to and withdraws from the balance)
- Bankroll Transaction Details (Date, deposit type, amount)
- Game History (List of every poker session played)
- Game Details (Session Hourly Rate, Session Net Profit, Date, Game Type, Blinds, Location, Duration, Buy In Amount, Cash Out Amount)
- Overall Hourly Rate
- Overall Net Profit
- Total Hours Played
- Average Session Duration
- Total Session Count
- Average Buy In
- Total Winning Sessions
- Total Losing Sessions
- Largest Win
- Largest Loss

The application is delivered in a sleek and simple GUI (Screenshots are attached in the Directory).
I look forward to making adjustments and furthur improving this project until it meets my criteria of a useful and successful product.
